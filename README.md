# 2023-Waterloo-Engineering-Competition-Survival-Simulation-Gear-Selection
Utilized linear programming techniques to optimize gear selection for a simulated survival competition. Using PuLP in python, formulated a linear objective function to quantitatively evaluate and select the most effective gear combination, implementing decision variables, constraints, and the objective function. Resolved the model to determine the most optimal gear configuration, demonstrating proficiency in LP problem-solving. Collaborated within a team under time constraints to design and implement the solution in a competitive environment.
