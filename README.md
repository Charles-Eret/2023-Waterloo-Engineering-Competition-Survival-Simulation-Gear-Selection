# 2023-Waterloo-Engineering-Competition-Survival-Simulation-Gear-Selection
Utilized linear programming techniques to optimize gear selection for a simulated survival competition. Using PuLP in python, formulated a linear objective function to quantitatively evaluate and select the most effective gear combination, implementing decision variables, constraints, and the objective function. Resolved the model to determine the most optimal gear configuration, demonstrating proficiency in LP problem-solving. Collaborated within a team under time constraints to design and implement the solution in a competitive environment.
Challenge: Each gear in gear.csv has a weight, survival usefulness, and combat usefulness. The goal is to maximize
both survival usefulness and combat usefulness without being over the weight limit chosen. In Stage 2 of this project, my team decided to simplify the object function and maximize usefulness, regardless of the type, by simplifying the two usefulness components into one (adding the usefulness component values). The weight limit chosen was 8.
